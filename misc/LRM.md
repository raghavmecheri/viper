# Data Types  
Viper supports the same primitive and higher-order data types as many modern languages. Primitive types are supported natively, while higher-order types are implemented in Viper's standard library. 

## Primitive Data Types
The five primitive types supported by Viper are ```char```, ```int```, ```float```, ```bool```, and ```nah```. The table below summarizes their important properties.

### ```char```
```char``` is the type that represents single ASCII characters. In Viper, a ```char``` is represented as an ASCII character enclosed in single quotes. Special characters, like the newline and tab characters, are defined with an escape backslash (```'\n'``` and ```'\t'```, respectively). Each ```char``` behaves like an ```int``` in that it takes on the decimal value of its assigned ASCII character. Therefore, numerical operations that are valid for integers are also valid for ```char```s.
