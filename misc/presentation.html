            <h2>An Overview</h2>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Type System</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Viper is strongly statically typed, with type checking performed at compile-time</li>
              <li>Support for int, float, char, bool, string and nah</li>
              <li>Library support for lists, dicts</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Ternary Operators & Pattern Matching</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Viper comes with support for both ternary operators, and a modified form of guard expressions</li>
              <li>Guard expressions are an alternative way of using conditional statements. Think of them as more powerful, more flexible, and better looking switch-case statements(example to follow)</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Arrow Functions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Viper comes with support for Arrow functions, for one line function definitions</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Moving away from the Pythonic indent system, Viper goes back to curly braces to define scope</li>
              <li>An easy way to get rid of tabs vs spaces arguements</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>In-built functions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Support for Math functions like ceil, floor, round, min, max, trunc</li>
              <li>Support for a couple of in-built functions you've just got to have: len() and print()</li>
              <li>Support for typecasting functions like int(), float(), char()</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Iterators</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Viper also has built-in support for loop iterators</li>
              <li>Support for iterating directly across values, as well as index, value pairs</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Viper's Structure & Sample</h2>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>The body of a Viper program consists of statements, and functions</li>
              <li>You can write code outside main!</li>
              <li>Globals are not accessible within functions, preventing Python-esque namespace conflicts</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Sample Program I</h2>
            <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>

            <h2>Handling Syntactic Sugar</h2>
          </section>
          <section>
            Viper has a lot of features that we were able to reduce to just syntactic sugar, to make the work easier when we need to generate LLVM
          </section>
          <section>
            Arrow functions are reduced to just regular functions
          </section>
          <section>
            Guard expressions are merely nested ternaries
          </section>
          <section>
            For loops, iterative for loops (for-in) and other types of syntactically sugared for-loops are all reduced to while loops
